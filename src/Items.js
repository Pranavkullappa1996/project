If you’re able to control your breathing, you’re less likely to experience the hyperventilating that can make other symptoms and the panic attack itself worse. Focus on taking deep breaths in and out through your mouth, feeling the air slowly fill your chest and belly and then slowly leave them again. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a second, and then breathe out for a count of four: Recognize that you’re having a panic attack By recognizing that you’re having a panic attack instead of a heart attack, you can remind yourself that this is temporary, it will pass, and that you’re OK. Take away the fear that you may be dying or that impending doom is looming, both symptoms of panic attacks. This can allow you to focus on other techniques to reduce your symptoms. Close your eyes Some panic attacks come from triggers that overwhelm you. If you’re in a fast-paced environment with a lot of stimuli, this can feed your panic attack. To reduce the stimuli, close your eyes during your panic attack. This can block out any extra stimuli and make it easier to focus on your breathing. powered by Rubicon ProjecT  Practice mindfulness Mindfulness can help ground you in the reality of what’s around you.

      blog: "Logan Paul and KSI are two well-known YouTubers, with over 20 million subscribers each. Their first fight (KSI vs. Logan Paul) took place in August of 2018 after a falling out online but ended in a draw. However, given that the first fight generated over $11 million, I would say Logan and KSI both left the fight as winners. The draw left viewers wanting more, fans of Logan Paul and KSI wondered if there would ever be a true champion. Since the fight in August of 2018, rumors have circulated about a rematch. Just months ago it was announced that there would be a rematch on November 9 in LA, and it was estimated that round two would bring in a whopping $20 million. Since announcing the second fight, KSI and Logan have released many diss tracks to hype up the fights…KSI’s track even goes as far as to mention the controversial scandal Logan Paul landed himself in upon filming in the Japanese Suicide forest years back.The fight was a wild and messy one. KSI started strong, knocking Logan Paul off his feet in which the ref deemed a “slip.” From there, things took a turn, as Logan felled KSI with a sole good shot of the night, only to be incorrectly penalized for a hold and hit. That penalty alone cost him the fight. Of the judges, only one scored in favor of Logan. The other two gave it to KSI, deeming KSI the winner of fight No. 2! This fight was laughable, entertaining, and everything we had hoped for and more. Logan is now appealing the decision. ",

      title: "THINKING OUT OF THE BOX",
      blog: "Thinking outside the box is more than just a business cliché. It means approaching problems in new, innovative ways; conceptualizing problems differently; and understanding your position in relation to any particular situation in a way you’d never thought of before. Ironically, its a cliché that means to think of clichéd situations in ways that aren’t clichéd. We’re told to “think outside the box” all the time, but how exactly do we do that? How do we develop the ability to confront problems in ways other than the ways we normally confront problems? How do we cultivate the ability to look at things differently from the way we typically look at things? Thinking outside the box starts well before we’re “boxed in” – that is, well before we confront a unique situation and start forcing it into a familiar “box” that we already know how to deal with. Or at least think we know how to deal with.",
